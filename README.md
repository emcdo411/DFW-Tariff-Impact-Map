# DFW-Tariff-Impact-Map: Visualizing Tariff Impacts on Oil & Gas Companies in the DFW Metroplex

![DFW Tariff Impact Map](dfw_2d_tariff_impact_map.png)

## üö® Attention Oil & Gas Leaders: Understand the Impact of Tariffs on Your Operations in DFW

The Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex is a hub for the oil and gas industry, home to major players like HF Sinclair, Energy Transfer, Valero, and Chevron. With a 25% tariff on the horizon, understanding its financial impact on your operations is critical. This project provides a **visual analysis** of how these tariffs will affect key oil and gas companies in the DFW area, using both **interactive maps** and **data-driven graphs** to highlight percentage impacts‚Äîpositive or negative. Whether you‚Äôre a decision-maker at an oil and gas firm or a stakeholder in the energy sector, this repository equips you with actionable insights to navigate the tariff landscape.

## üìã Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of a 25% tariff on four major oil and gas companies in the DFW Metroplex:
- **HF Sinclair**: -0.22% (negative impact)
- **Energy Transfer**: +0.1% (positive impact)
- **Valero**: -0.48% (negative impact)
- **Chevron**: +0.3% (positive impact)

We initially attempted to create an advanced plot map using `tmap`, but due to persistent errors, we pivoted to using `ggmap` with `get_stadiamap()` to create a 2D map styled like Apple Maps or Google Maps. When `get_stadiamap()` required an API key, we provided an alternative using `osmdata` to fetch OpenStreetMap data, ensuring accessibility for users without API keys. Additionally, we created a bar graph to visualize the tariff impacts as a non-spatial alternative.

### Outputs
- **2D Map (Stadia Maps)**: A map of the DFW Metroplex with company locations, showing tariff impacts (requires a Stadia Maps API key).
- **2D Map (OpenStreetMap)**: An alternative map using OpenStreetMap data, no API key required.
- **Bar Graph**: A non-spatial visualization of the tariff impacts for each company.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code

Below is the complete code used in this project, including all attempts (successful and unsuccessful) to create the visualizations.

### 1. Initial Attempt: Advanced Plot Map with `tmap`
This attempt used `tmap` to create a terrain map with elevation data, but it failed due to an error: `Error in call(paste0("tm_", layer))`.

```R
# Load the libraries
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(tmap)
library(elevatr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(cols4all)

# Set tmap option to disable autoscaling
tmap_options(component.autoscale = FALSE)

# Filter for DFW Metroplex counties
dfw_counties <- texas_counties %>%
  dplyr::filter(NAME %in% c("Dallas", "Tarrant", "Collin", "Denton"))

# Download elevation data
dfw_elevation <- get_elev_raster(locations = dfw_counties, z = 10)

# Create a dataset for company locations with percentage impacts
company_data <- tibble(
  Company = c("HF Sinclair", "Energy Transfer", "Valero", "Chevron"),
  Latitude = c(32.7918, 32.8673, 32.6761, 32.8790),
  Longitude = c(-96.8039, -96.7685, -96.7665, -96.9392),
  Percent_Impact = c(-0.22, 0.1, -0.48, 0.3),
  Abs_Percent_Impact = abs(Percent_Impact),
  Impact_Direction = c("Negative", "Positive", "Negative", "Positive"),
  Label = c("HF Sinclair: -0.22%", "Energy Transfer: +0.1%", "Valero: -0.48%", "Chevron: +0.3%")
)

# Convert to an sf object for spatial plotting
company_sf <- st_as_sf(company_data, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Reproject to EPSG:4326 for consistency
dfw_counties <- st_transform(dfw_counties, crs = 4326)
company_sf <- st_transform(company_sf, crs = 4326)

# Print the company_sf dataset to the console
print("Displaying the company data used for the map:")
print(company_sf)

# Create the advanced plot map using tmap
tm_map <- tm_shape(dfw_elevation) +
  tm_raster(style = "cont", palette = "brewer.greens", title = "Elevation (m)") +
  tm_shape(dfw_counties) +
  tm_borders(col = "black", lwd = 2) +
  tm_shape(company_sf) +
  tm_dots(
    size = "Abs_Percent_Impact",
    sizes.legend = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5),
    scale = 2,
    col = "Impact_Direction",
    palette = c("Negative" = "brewer.reds", "Positive" = "brewer.greens"),
    title.size = "Impact Magnitude (%)",
    title.col = "Impact Direction",
    alpha = 0.8,
    border.col = "black",
    border.lwd = 1
  ) +
  tm_text("Label", just = "top", size = 0.8, ymod = 2.0, col = "black", bg.color = "white", bg.alpha = 0.7) +
  tm_add_legend(
    type = "symbol",
    col = c("red", "green"),
    labels = c("Negative Impact", "Positive Impact"),
    title = "Impact Direction"
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "top")) +
  tm_layout(
    main.title = "DFW Metroplex: Tariff Impact on Oil and Gas Companies",
    main.title.position = "center",
    main.title.size = 1.2,
    legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
    legend.text.size = 0.8,
    frame = TRUE
  )

# Add the fuel price impact as a separate annotation
tm_map <- tm_map +
  tm_credits(
    text = "Fuel Price Impact: 8.61 cents/gallon increase in urban centers.",
    position = c("right", "bottom"),
    size = 0.7,
    align = "left"
  )

# Print the map to the plot window
print("Displaying the advanced tariff impact map in the plot window:")
tmap_mode("plot")
print(tm_map)

# Save the map with larger dimensions
tmap_save(tm_map, filename = "dfw_advanced_tariff_impact_map_with_print.png", width = 14, height = 10, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

**Note**: This code failed with the error `Error in call(paste0("tm_", layer))`, so we pivoted to alternative approaches.

---

### 2. Bar Graph with `ggplot2`
As a non-spatial alternative, we created a bar graph to visualize the tariff impacts.

```R
# Load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

# Create a dataset for company percentage impacts
company_data <- tibble(
  Company = c("HF Sinclair", "Energy Transfer", "Valero", "Chevron"),
  Percent_Impact = c(-0.22, 0.1, -0.48, 0.3),
  Impact_Direction = c("Negative", "Positive", "Negative", "Positive"),
  Label = c("HF Sinclair: -0.22%", "Energy Transfer: +0.1%", "Valero: -0.48%", "Chevron: +0.3%")
)

# Print the dataset to the console for verification
print("Displaying the company data used for the graph:")
print(company_data)

# Create the bar graph
ggplot(data = company_data, aes(x = Company, y = Percent_Impact, fill = Impact_Direction)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", width = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Negative" = "red", "Positive" = "green"), name = "Impact Direction") +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = sprintf("%.2f%%", Percent_Impact), 
        y = ifelse(Percent_Impact >= 0, Percent_Impact + 0.05, Percent_Impact - 0.05)),
    size = 4,
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Percentage Impact of 25% Tariff (%)",
    breaks = seq(-0.6, 0.6, by = 0.1),
    labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Company") +
  labs(
    title = "Tariff Impact on Oil and Gas Companies in DFW Metroplex",
    caption = "Fuel Price Impact: 8.61 cents/gallon increase in urban centers."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  )

# Save the graph
ggsave("dfw_tariff_impact_graph.png", width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

### 3. 2D Map with `ggmap` and `get_stadiamap()` (Requires API Key)
This approach uses `ggmap` with `get_stadiamap()` to create a 2D map styled like Apple Maps or Google Maps. It requires a Stadia Maps API key.

```R
# Load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(ggrepel)

# Register the Stadia Maps API key
register_stadiamaps(key = "YOUR_API_KEY")

# Create a dataset for company locations with percentage impacts
company_data <- tibble(
  Company = c("HF Sinclair", "Energy Transfer", "Valero", "Chevron"),
  Latitude = c(32.7918, 32.8673, 32.6761, 32.8790),
  Longitude = c(-96.8039, -96.7685, -96.7665, -96.9392),
  Percent_Impact = c(-0.22, 0.1, -0.48, 0.3),
  Abs_Percent_Impact = abs(Percent_Impact),
  Impact_Direction = c("Negative", "Positive", "Negative", "Positive"),
  Label = c("HF Sinclair: -0.22%", "Energy Transfer: +0.1%", "Valero: -0.48%", "Chevron: +0.3%")
)

# Print the dataset to the console for verification
print("Displaying the company data used for the map:")
print(company_data)

# Define the bounding box for the DFW Metroplex
dfw_bbox <- c(left = -97.5, bottom = 32.5, right = -96.5, top = 33.3)

# Fetch the base map using ggmap (Stadia map with Stamen.Terrain style)
dfw_map <- get_stadiamap(
  bbox = dfw_bbox,
  maptype = "stamen_terrain",
  zoom = 10
)

# Create the 2D map with ggmap and ggplot2
ggmap(dfw_map) +
  geom_point(
    data = company_data,
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, size = Abs_Percent_Impact, color = Impact_Direction),
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  scale_size_continuous(
    name = "Impact Magnitude (%)",
    range = c(3, 10),
    breaks = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5)
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("Negative" = "red", "Positive" = "green"),
    name = "Impact Direction"
  ) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = company_data,
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, label = Label),
    size = 3,
    box.padding = 0.5,
    point.padding = 0.5,
    segment.color = "black",
    fill = "white",
    alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "DFW Metroplex: Tariff Impact on Oil and Gas Companies",
    caption = "Fuel Price Impact: 8.61 cents/gallon increase in urban centers."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8)
  )

# Save the map
ggsave("dfw_2d_tariff_impact_map.png", width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

**Note**: Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your Stadia Maps API key, obtained from `https://stadiamaps.com/`.

### 4. 2D Map with `osmdata` (No API Key Required)
This approach uses OpenStreetMap data via `osmdata` to create a 2D map without requiring an API key.

```R
# Load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(osmdata)
library(ggrepel)
library(sf)

# Define the bounding box for the DFW Metroplex
dfw_bbox <- c(-97.5, 32.5, -96.5, 33.3)

# Create an OpenStreetMap query for the DFW area
dfw_query <- opq(bbox = dfw_bbox)

# Fetch highways (major roads)
highways <- dfw_query %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = c("motorway", "trunk", "primary", "secondary")) %>%
  osmdata_sf()

# Fetch smaller roads (for additional detail)
roads <- dfw_query %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway", value = c("tertiary", "residential")) %>%
  osmdata_sf()

# Fetch water bodies (rivers, lakes)
water <- dfw_query %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "natural", value = "water") %>%
  osmdata_sf()

# Create a dataset for company locations with percentage impacts
company_data <- tibble(
  Company = c("HF Sinclair", "Energy Transfer", "Valero", "Chevron"),
  Latitude = c(32.7918, 32.8673, 32.6761, 32.8790),
  Longitude = c(-96.8039, -96.7685, -96.7665, -96.9392),
  Percent_Impact = c(-0.22, 0.1, -0.48, 0.3),
  Abs_Percent_Impact = abs(Percent_Impact),
  Impact_Direction = c("Negative", "Positive", "Negative", "Positive"),
  Label = c("HF Sinclair: -0.22%", "Energy Transfer: +0.1%", "Valero: -0.48%", "Chevron: +0.3%")
)

# Create the 2D map with ggplot2
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = water$osm_polygons, fill = "lightblue", color = NA, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = roads$osm_lines, color = "gray70", size = 0.2) +
  geom_sf(data = highways$osm_lines, color = "gray30", size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(
    data = company_data,
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, size = Abs_Percent_Impact, color = Impact_Direction),
    alpha = 0.8
  ) +
  scale_size_continuous(
    name = "Impact Magnitude (%)",
    range = c(3, 10),
    breaks = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5)
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("Negative" = "red", "Positive" = "green"),
    name = "Impact Direction"

  geom_label_repel(
    data = company_data,
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, label = Label),
    size = 3,
    box.padding = 0.5,
    point.padding = 0.5,
    segment.color = "black",
    fill = "white",
    alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-97.5, -96.5), ylim = c(32.5, 33.3), crs = st_crs(4326)) +
  labs(
    title = "DFW Metroplex: Tariff Impact on Oil and Gas Companies",
    caption = "Fuel Price Impact: 8.61 cents/gallon increase in urban centers.\nData: OpenStreetMap contributors"
  ) +

    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )

# Save the map
ggsave("dfw_2d_tariff_impact_map_osm.png", width = 10, height = 8, dpi = 300, units = "in")
```

## üìä Why This Matters

The oil and gas industry operates on tight margins, where even small percentage changes in costs can have significant financial implications. A 25% tariff, as analyzed in this project, could lead to:
- **Cost Increases**: Valero faces a -0.48% impact, translating to a $676M annual cost increase, which could affect fuel prices and profitability.
- **Competitive Advantages**: Chevron‚Äôs +0.3% positive impact due to tariff exemptions could give it a market edge, potentially reshaping competition in the DFW region.
- **Fuel Price Impacts**: An 8.61 cents/gallon increase in urban centers could influence consumer behavior and demand, directly affecting downstream operations.
- **Strategic Planning**: Understanding these impacts allows companies to adjust supply chains, explore alternative markets, or lobby for policy changes.

For oil and gas companies in the DFW Metroplex, this analysis provides a **visual and data-driven tool** to assess the tariff‚Äôs effects, enabling better decision-making in a volatile economic landscape. Whether you‚Äôre optimizing operations, planning investments, or mitigating risks, this project offers insights to stay ahead.

## üìù Conclusion

The `DFW-Tariff-Impact-Map` repository delivers a comprehensive analysis of how a 25% tariff affects oil and gas companies in the DFW Metroplex. Despite challenges with `tmap`, we successfully created a 2D map using `ggmap` (with a Stadia Maps API key) and an alternative map using `osmdata` (no API key required). We also provided a bar graph for a non-spatial perspective. These visualizations empower oil and gas companies to understand the financial implications of tariffs, make informed decisions, and strategize for the future.

Feel free to fork this repository, adapt the code for your region or company, and contribute to enhancing the analysis. Let‚Äôs navigate the tariff landscape together!
